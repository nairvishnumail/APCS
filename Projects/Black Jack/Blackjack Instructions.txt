How to Play Single Deck Blackjack


The main objective of
Single Deck Blackjack is to get a hand value of 21 or as close as possible to
21 before the dealer without busting(going over 21). An alternative is to stand
and have the dealer bust. Before the game starts, you place a bet. Then you and
the dealer are dealt cards. The dealer is dealt one face up card and one face
down. You are dealt two face up cards. Based on the cards in front of you and
the face up card of the dealer you decide whether to stand(stop drawing cards),
hit(draw more cards), double down(don’t need to code) or split cards(don’t need
to code). Once the player is done, then the dealer will draw cards until they
reach a number greater or equal to 17. If they draw anything 22 or above, they
bust.
